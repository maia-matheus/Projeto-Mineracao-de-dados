# U.S. Hospital Customer Satisfaction 2016-2020

## Context
How satisfied are U.S. patients? Is a hospital's overall score really determined by how well it provides good customer services? Are there types of hospitals or regions where patient satisfaction is better or worse?

Every year, all U.S. hospitals that accept payments from Medicare and Medicaid must submit quality data to The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS' Hospital Compare program is a consumer-oriented website that provides information on "the quality of care hospitals are providing to their patients." CMS releases this quality data publicly in order to encourage hospitals to improve their quality and to help consumer make better decisions about which providers they visit.

"Hospital Compare provides data on over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals, including acute care hospitals, critical access hospitals (CAHs), children’s hospitals, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Medical Centers, and hospital outpatient departments"

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a five-star quality rating system to measure the experiences Medicare beneficiaries have with their health plan and health care system — the Star Rating Program. Health plans are rated on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest.

One part of a hospital's overall rating is it's patient satisfaction survey scores. CMS attempts to take into consideration how well patients are treated by the provider.
